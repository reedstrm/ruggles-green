Repository global todo items

* Solve the Eclipse java formatter issues.
* Revisit all the TODO's and address the ones that need to be addressed for the Pilot (if any)
* Add support for exporters (feeds, urgent items, etc)
* Clean up all compilations and startup warnings

* Cleanup unused code in CnxMediaType and FileContentTypeEnum (arjun)
* Delete the temp servlets as soon as the actual API will be ready.

Post Pilot
* (Security) Add verifications that uploaded completion method are actually called from blobstore and not directly by a user.
* Add API method to lookup resources by size/hash
* Incoming XML update/validation (modify incoming XML with repository values (e.g. version)).
* parameter validations (in the servlets and the service)
* User authentication (in Atompub API)
* User authorization (in service)
* Support for search ??? (or will CNX do that?)
* Consider to have some support for automatic resource/export content type determination if user did not provide.
* Add ability to take down content (e.g. 'invisible' flag in CNXML and resource entities)
