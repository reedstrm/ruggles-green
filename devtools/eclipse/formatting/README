cnx-eclipse-java-formatting.xml
----------------------------------
An eclipse formatting configuration for CNX style guide. Original copy
is from http://openjpa.apache.org/coding-standards.html (as of July 20, 2011,
license is Apache 2.0, used the 'galileo' version).

To apply in Eclipse
1. Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter
2. Click on Import and select the cnx-eclipse-java-formatting.xml file
3. Press OK importing

Static import preference setting (can be done only manually?)
1. Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Editor -> Content Assist -> Favorites
2. Click New Type and add com.google.common.base.Preconditions.*
3. Ok

To export new version from Eclipse
1. Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter
2. Click on Editi
3. Click on Export and overwrite cnx-eclipse-java-formatting.xml file
4. Diff the file against the repository to make sure all changes are desired. If
   more than one profile has been exported, clean it manually (is there a way
   to tell Eclipse to export only a single style?)

Style changes from Sun Java style
1. Maximum line length is 100
2. Use spaces instead of tabs.
3. Indendation size is 4 spaces.
4. Do not insert a new line before opening brace. 
5. Insert a new line before closing brace.
6. Use fully qualified import statements, i.e. do not use asterisks.
7. Treating acronyms as words in camel case (good: CnxRepository, bad: CNXRepository).

Other style recomendations
1. Prefer static import for check methods of com.google.common.base.Precondtions.
