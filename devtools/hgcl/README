This is a collection of scripts used by light to submit CLs using Mercurial's
patch queue feature.

Setup
=======

1) Install the hgsubversion plugin at: https://bitbucket.org/durin42/hgsubversion/
2) Enable the patch queue extension
3) Place upload.py in your path, or modify cnx-review to match your upload.py script.
4) Place cnx-* in your path.
5) Clone the repository: ``hg clone https://ruggles-green.googlecode.com/svn/ ruggles-green``

Creating a CL
===============

1) Make your changes
2) Save changes with ``hg qnew PATCHNAME``
3) Run ``cnx-newcl PATCHNAME``, with any additional arguments that you want to pass to upload.py after PATCHNAME

**Note that your patch must be applied in order to run cnx-newcl.**

Your patch will be renamed to cl#####, where ##### is the number you entered.
The CL description and subject will be grabbed automatically from the patch's
commit message.

Updating a CL
===============

1) Make your changes
2) Run ``hg qref`` on your cl##### patch
3) Run ``cnx-cl #####``, with any additional arguments that you want to pass to upload.py after #####

**Note that your patch must be applied in order to run cnx-cl.**

Submitting a CL
=================

This is a standard Mercurial push.
