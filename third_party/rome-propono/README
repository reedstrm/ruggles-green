rome-propono was downloaded from http://java.net/projects/rome/sources/svn/show/trunk/subprojects/propono
and then source was compiled and converted to jar.

Since rome-propono client uses HttpClient which cannot run on AppEngine, so its original
code was patched and HttpClient was overriden with CustomHttpClient which wraps
UrlFetch calls, so that it can work on AppEngine.
